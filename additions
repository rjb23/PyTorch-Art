##a pytorch art maker, based on the user's input on their 5  favorite colors, generate  image_size = 64 based on these users inputs and generate the image using pytorch
##I have to work on getting the the input's random colors and generate an image based with just those colors.. This code does a version of that with not as many as I would like

import torch
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the user's favorite colors
favorite_colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'purple', 'orange']

# Define the size of the image
image_size = 64

# Create a tensor of size (3,) with the RGB values of the user's favorite color
dot_colors = [torch.tensor([255, 0, 0]),  # red
              torch.tensor([0, 0, 255]),  # blue
              torch.tensor([0, 255, 0]),  # green
              torch.tensor([128, 0, 128]),  # purple
              torch.tensor([255, 165, 0])]  # orange

# Create an empty tensor of size (3, 64, 64) to represent the image
image = torch.zeros((3, image_size, image_size))

# Generate the image
for i in range(image_size):
    for j in range(image_size):
        # Add a tiny colored dot at this location with a random favorite color
        if torch.rand(1) < 0.01:
            dot_color = dot_colors[torch.randint(len(dot_colors), size=(1,)).item()]
            image[:, i, j] = dot_color

# Convert the tensor to a numpy array and transpose it to (image_size, image_size, 3)
image = image.permute(1, 2, 0).numpy()

# Display the image
plt.imshow(image)
plt.show()
